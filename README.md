## About The Project

![Screenshot](/assets/browser.png)

There are many self-hosted Perplexity clones out there. I chose to make my own as I was dissatisfied with their non-existent integration with other self-hosted services and lack of multi-user support. Perplexideez is backed by a Postgres database & either Ollama or OpenAI compatible endpoints. It searches the web using a SearXNG instance.

## Deploying

Currently this project is under heavy development and there is no deployment support available. Please wait until it's ready. Thanks!

### Built With

- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev)

## Developing Locally

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You need either an OpenAI API token/OpenAI compatible API or an Ollama instance running somewhere. The development container setup only provides Postgres and SearXNG.

- pnpm
  ```sh
  corepack install pnpm
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/brunostjohn/perplexideez.git
   ```
2. Install packages
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file using the `.env.example`
4. Start the development environment
   ```sh
   pnpm dev:up
   ```
5. Update the database schema
   ```sh
   pnpm db:push
   ```
6. Run the app
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```
